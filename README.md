# Hexude-PL
This repository contains the interpreter for my custom programming language 'Hexude', along with additional utilities and tools for language development and usage.

### The project has just begun its operational phase.

Briefly, this is my interpretation of a programming language. **SO FAR**, it has not been widely used, but I am confident that once we finalize the core syntax, its applications will become evident. The goal is to create a powerful, flexible, and efficient scripting language, blending elements from JavaScript, Lua, and C#.

Future development plans include:
- Implementing a robust parser
- Enhancing the interpreter with advanced features
- Expanding standard libraries
- Optimizing performance for real-world usage

Stay tuned for updates!
